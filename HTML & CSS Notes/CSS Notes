CSS Notes

Cascading:
- The last defined style is what takes precendence. 
	- If two selectors (P's for example) are defined, the second one will be applied over the first.
	- If two STYLES are defined for one selector, the second style is applied. 

Selectors
1. Type - Lowest weight
2. Class (.) - Medium weight
3. ID (#) - Highest weight

*The higher the selector weight, the more superiorirty it has. 

Combining Selectors
- Selectors are read right to left.
- The selector to the most right is the KEY SELECTOR - identifies which element the style is applied to. 
- .hotdog p{} : selects all P types within a hotdog class
- .hotdog p.mustard : selects all P types with a mustard class within a hotdog class. 

Pixels lengths
 - A pixel is 1/96th of an inch.
 - 96 pixels = 1 inch
 - Very precise, but unreliable due to different pixels on different machines

 Percentage Lengths
 - Defined in relation to the length of another object
 - 50% width of INNER element needs to the know width of the OUTER object

 em unit
 - length is based on the elements font size
 - If element font size is 14px, 5em would be 70px (14x5)
