HTML Notes

Semantics within HTML - practice of giving the content on the page meaning and structure by using the proper element. 

Divs and Spans
 - Have no Semantic Value. They exist for styling purposes. 
 - They are simply containers. 

 Blocks vs. Inline Elements
 - Block-level elements begin on a new line, stacking one on top of the other, and occupy any available width. Block-level elements may be nested inside one another and may wrap inline-level elements. We’ll most commonly see block-level elements used for larger pieces of content, such as paragraphs.
 - Inline-level elements do not begin on a new line. They fall into the normal flow of a document, lining up one after the other, and only maintain the width of their content. Inline-level elements may be nested inside one another; however, they cannot wrap block-level elements. We’ll usually see inline-level elements with smaller pieces of content, such as a few words.

Divs: 
- Block level element used to identify large groupings of elements. 

Spans:
- Inline-level element used to identify smaller groupings of text within a block element.

Headings:
- Block level elements.
- Be sure to use semantically, and not just to make bold text.
- To add background color, add a span within the <h>

Paragraphs
- Block level elements for regular text.

Strong & B
- Bold text, inline level
- Use strong for very prominent items.
- Use b for more casual inline bolded items. 

EM and I
- Same as above. EM for more emphasis. 

Building Structure
- HTML5 has structurarly based elements.
	- header, nav, article, section, aside and footer

Header
- Top of the body.
- Not to be confused with Head. Header falls within the BODY of the page. 
- Head element is not actually displayed on the page. It outlines metadata. 

Nav
- Used for primary navigation sections only. 

Article
- Used to identify independent, self-contained content. Blog posts, newspaper articles, etc. 

Section
- Used for a thematic grouping of content. Maybe a group of articles. 

Article, section, or Div
- Reserve div for block styling purposes. 

Aside
- holds content, such as sidebars, inserts, or brief explanations, that is tangentially related to the content surrounding it. 
- Block element, so it needs to be positioned by developer appropriately.
